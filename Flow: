Flow:
Create Population from config
which creates many genomes within the population
then you evaluate each genome upon the Gym environment
to evaluate each genome you first convert the nodes and connections to a network that can take the inputs through each connection to an output. 
(this should also prune the unnecessary connections and nodes from the network before evaluating)
then this output should be passed thorugh an activation function to convert the values of the output nodes to an action from the Gym Environment
